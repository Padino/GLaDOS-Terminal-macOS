**GLaDOS-Terminal** is a chatbot that brings the iconic GLaDOS personality to life through a retro terminal interface. Designed from the ground up, this project uses custom AI models and graphics to simulate realistic conversations with the infamous AI from the *Portal* games.

## Features

- **Completely Custom Experience**:
  - The visuals are built entirely using `pygame` and a fully original `moderngl` screen shader inspired by the *Portal* end credits.
  - The GLaDOS voice is generated in real-time using custom fine-tuned **Tacotron 2** and **HiFi-GAN** models, which I’ve modified and improved through my own forks for higher accuracy and fidelity.
- **AI-Driven Personality**:
  - Powered by the `llama3.2:3b` model through `ollama`, GLaDOS’s responses are true to her character.
  - A custom system prompt ensures the personality feels authentic and recognizable.
- **Dynamic Voice Generation**:
  - Speech synthesis creates the authentic GLaDOS voice in real time, ensuring seamless conversation flow.
  - The Tacotron 2 and HiFi-GAN models are automatically downloaded on first launch for convenience.
- **Immersive Aesthetic**:
  - The retro terminal look and scrolling system messages help capture the atmosphere of Aperture Science that we all know and love.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This program is designed to run on modern hardware, as it uses multiple resource-intensive components:
- Real-time text-to-speech with **Tacotron 2** and **HiFi-GAN**
- AI responses generated by **llama3.2:3b** via `ollama`
- A custom **moderngl screen shader** for the retro visuals

### Performance Considerations

- **Recommended Hardware**:
  - A multi-core processor (Quad-Core or better)
  - At least 8GB of RAM, though 16GB is preferred
  - A capable GPU for running the graphics and AI efficiently
- Running this program on older or underpowered systems may result in poor performance or crashes.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LuckeyDuckey/GLaDOS-Terminal.git
   cd GLaDOS-Terminal
   ```

2. Install dependencies from the requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Pytorch from official website, instructions can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

4. Ensure **ollama** is installed and running on your system. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://ollama.ai/).

5. Create the models folder
   ```bash
   cd Scripts
   mkdir models
   ```

6. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

   The voice models and language model will automatically download on first launch.

> **Note for Non-Programmers**:  
> This project may be challenging to set up if you’re unfamiliar with Python or command-line tools. I plan to release a pre-packaged executable (.exe) soon to make the program easier to use for everyone.

## Model Updates and Timeline

The Tacotron 2 and HiFi-GAN models used in this project will not auto-update. When updates are available, they will be announced here, and you'll need to modify your Settings.json file to use the newer models.
